### Briefly About Myself

I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (educational program: Computer Science and System Design) at Novosibirsk State University.

During my studies at the university, I was focused on academic disciplines and after graduation I decided to deepen my knowledge of front-end development. I chose frontend development because in this area I can realize my creative potential and apply my technical skills by creating beautiful, user-friendly and technological websites.

**My strengths include**:
humanity, stress tolerance, endurance, sociability/ the ability to find an approach to almost any person, responsibility, diligence, leadership qualities, the desire for constant self-improvement.

In the next 5 years of my life, my main goal will be to find a field in which I can realize my potential.
